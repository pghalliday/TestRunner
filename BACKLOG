backlog:
--------

As a user I want to be able to send client tests to a browser using node so that I can run all my tests from one place
	*server should emit an event when a listener connects
	listener should connect to server on load
	listener should run tests using mocha
	runner should send tests to server
	listener should run tests sent from server
	listener should report success or failure back to server
	server should report success or failure back to the runner

As a user I want to be able to ensure that tests are run on all supported browsers so that i know very early when one of them breaks
	runner should specify what listeners (browsers) tests need to be run on
	server should wait for all required listeners to complete before signalling the runner
	
As a user I want to be able to test RequireJS (AMD) modules so that I can modularise my client side code and load it on demand
	listener should support RequireJS and loading modules at runtime
	
As a user I want to be able to rerun my tests and bring the server up and down without having to reconnect browsers so that I can run my tests over and over again quickly
	listener should reconnect after disconnection
	
As a user I want to see the progress of tests being run in my command prompt so that I have a sense that things are happening
	listener should report back test progress
	
As a user I want to be able to use frameworks other than mocha for testing so that I do not have to switch away from the tools i am comfortable with
	listener should support multiple test frameworks


todo:
-----

handle/queue concurrent test runs?
flow control?
